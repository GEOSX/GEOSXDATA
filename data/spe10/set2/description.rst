===============
SPE10 Dataset 2
===============

Summary
-------

This directory contains permeability and porosity data provided for the SPE10 Model 2 benchmark.  The original description can be found here:

    http://www.spe.org/web/csp/datasets/set02.htm

The original files have been unpackaged and renamed ``permeability.dat`` and ``porosity.dat``.  Otherwise, these files are unchanged and should be considered the raw version.

Processing
----------

We will likely provide a VTK-format version in the near future.
