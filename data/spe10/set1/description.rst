Summary
-------

The SPE10 Dataset 1 benchmark description can be found here:

  http://www.spe.org/web/csp/datasets/set01.htm

The ``.dat`` files contain the original permeability field and relative permeability table.  The files have been renamed, but the raw data has not been touched.

Processing
----------

We will likely provide a VTK-formatted version in the near future
